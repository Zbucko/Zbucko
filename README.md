# Hi there, I'm Luka üëã

I'm a software engineering student at the **Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad**.  
I enjoy fullstack web development and have a strong interest in game development, even though I'm just starting to explore it.  
I'm a team player who values collaboration and communication, and I love working on projects that solve real-world problems.
